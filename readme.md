# Vega React workshop v1

This workshop is going to be unique as compared to other React introductions because this course attempts to teach you not only React but the ecosystem around React. When I was learning React myself, I found myself frustrated that it seemed like every tutorial started on step 14 and left out the steps 1-13 of how to set up a React project. React is nearly never used by itself, so it's useful to know the tools you're using. I believe you, as a developer, should know how your tools work and what purpose they're serving. Hopefully, given the knowledge of the problem solved by the tool, you'll embrace the tools despite their complexities due to the ease and power they offer you.

## Who is this workshop for

You, hopefully. ðŸ˜„ This workshop is for anyone who wants to know React better. The workshop assumes you have basic knowledge of JavaScript. This course will equally be useful for people learning React for the first time as it is for people who have written some React but want to understand the tools better.

## Who am I

My name is Aleksa Mitic and I am a software developer at Vega IT. I work on Unite Students project which provides student accomodation in United Kingdom. Before that I was spending my time learning JavaScrpit and React
making some cool projects that would actually get me a job in the industry. ðŸ˜„

When I'm not working or developing workshops for Vega, you'll find me in Nis if not there then in Novi Sad. I love to travel, blasting my PR records in powerlifting, reading self-improvement books, play World of Tanks poorly, as well as drink local IPAs and coffees.

## How the repo works

Every step of this project will have a folder that will be a snapshot of where the project is at that step. If you get stuck, want to copy/paste some long bit of code you don't feel like writing, or just want to walk through the code at that point, please do! The primary goal of this is for you to learn so as long as you're learning there's no cheating!

The naming format will be `XX-<name of the lesson>` so you can get a rough idea of order and which lesson the step is coming from. In each snapshot you'll have to run `npm install` again since it'll literally just be another whole copy of the project.
